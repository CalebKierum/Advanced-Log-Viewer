# Advanced Log Viewer - Beta
A python based cross-platform log viewer with powerful features like historical summaries and advanced highlighting.

## Problems this tool solves
1. You should never have to scroll backwards in a log to determine your state at a current line
2. Extensive state update printing crowds your log
3. Highlighting

### Warning
This is a beta software. I wrote this very quickly while also trying to get through University coursework. It is littered with typos and probably errors too. There will be bugs. Some of them may crash the software, others may cause the console to subtly print out warnings, others may cause correct input. For the most part it will be correct but if something really does not make sense make sure to look at the log in a different viewer or ignore the top view.

## ToDo List
- Add ctrl+f
- Add jumpt to line
- Add stable upper log viewing
- Implement moveable divider in upper log
